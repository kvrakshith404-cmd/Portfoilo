Futuristic Portfolio — RAKSHITH K V

Files:
- `raks.html` — main portfolio HTML page (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- `portfolio.css` — styles with futuristic theme and responsive layout
- `portfolio.js` — simple interactions: mobile nav, smooth scroll, form feedback

How to view:
1. Open `raks.html` in a browser (double-click or use Live Server).
2. Replace `rakshith.jpg` with your avatar file in the same folder for the avatar.

Notes:
- This is a static front-end only demo (no server required).
- Replace the LinkedIn URL in `raks.html` with your profile link.

Optional next steps:
- Add animations for the gradient ring around the avatar.
- Add real contact handling (backend endpoint) for the form.
